## Step 3: Be sure you complete all required fields (required fields have a red asterisk after the label)
**NOTE:** The Questions field will be shared with your reviewer, so they may address your questions when reviewing your work.  However, if you wish to have a **faster** answer to your questions, be sure you are asking them during your mentor session(s) or are posting them in the #borr-discussion channel in Slack.
