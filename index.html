    <h1>About</h1>
           <p>Hi I'm Aboubacar! I'm a web developer who loves problem-solving. After previous career as a financial auditor in a big4 and an oil and gas company, I decided to completely change my professional life and to become a programmer.
            I'm currently completing the intro to programming certificate at Code The Dream.</p>
