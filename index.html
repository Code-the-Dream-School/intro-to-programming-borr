    <h4> About</h4>
    <h5> My professional career began in Dallas, TX as a teacher. I had wondersful experiances in my time as an educator, and learned the value of community, perserverence, and patience. I've always considered myself a lifelong learner, and began learning about computer programing through my network. I was intreged by the many positive experiances I heard from other programmers and decided to learn. After teaching math for 5 years, I became an excellent problem solver, which made my love for programming come naturally. Now, I'm excited to take what I have learned to help mentor and teach others while creating projects to showcase the beauty of our community.</h5>
