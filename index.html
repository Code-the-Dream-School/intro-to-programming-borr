Alejandro Patino Camargo

About Me: 
Hello! My name is Alejandro and I am a transfer student attending San Jose State University in the fall.
I have a keen interest and passion for music, computer languages and art, and I believe there is a creative fusion between these disciplines. 
I engage wholeheartedly in these areas both in school courses and outside of school, 
and I hope that I will be able to continue doing so as I transfer to University.

Experience:
I am currently an intern at Dream SF where I'm an advocate for San Franciscoâ€™s immigrant communities.
I currently work on corrdinating fundraising and donor events whith a large emphisis in 
drafting grant proposals for in-house and local organizations/nonprofits.
