      <h1>About Me:</h1>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Alejandro and I am a transfer student attending San
        Jose State University in the fall. I have a keen interest and passion
        for music, computer languages and art, and I believe there is a creative
        fusion between these disciplines. I engage wholeheartedly in these areas
        both in school courses and outside of school, and I hope that I will be
        able to continue doing so as I transfer to University.
      </p>
