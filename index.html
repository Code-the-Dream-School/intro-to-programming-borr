        <h1>About </h1>
        
         <p>My name is KJ. I was born and raised in WA state but relocated to Oregon to be with my wife just over half a decade ago. When I'm not enjoying family time with my wife and various pets, I can be found partaking in one of my many hobbies. From video games to wood carving, I've yet to find a hobbie I haven't liked!</p>
        
        <h1>Experience</h1>
        
         <p>Most of my career experience since the pandemic has been in social work, but over the last six months I've been working on a graphic design portfolio and small coding projects. My pride and joy right now is a 'Whale Translator' that I programmed myself from scratch! </p>
